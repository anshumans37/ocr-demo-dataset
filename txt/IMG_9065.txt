Bake On

THE WORLD’S BIGGEST COFFEE MORNING
THURSDAY 28 SEPTEMBER

Bring a reusable mug, if possible, and join us near the sundial by the entrance to the Inner Temple Garden on Thursday 28 September between 10.30am and 1.30pm, as we take part in the world's biggest Coffee Morning, in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support.

If you would like to offer some home-made sweet or savoury produce, we want to hear from you!
