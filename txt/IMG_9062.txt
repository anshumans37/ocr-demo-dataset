THE SMIRKES AND THE INNER TEMPLE
The Building of the Victorian Inner Temple
Dr Geoffrey Tyack
Architectural historian and Emeritus Fellow of Kellogg College, Oxford
For fifty year in the middle of the 19th Century Sir Robert Smirke and his younger
brother, Sydney, were responsible for the remodelling of the Inner Temple. By 1870 over
half the Inn had been rebuilt to their plans. Much of it remains although the Hall, library
and Treasury were destroyed in the fateful bombing of May 1941.
The brothers, particularly Sir Robert, were among the most significant architects of their
time with buildings such as the British Museum and its reading-room to their credit.
Their work reflected the changing tastes of the times from Classicism to the Gothic
Revival and fine examples can still be seen in the Inn today.
