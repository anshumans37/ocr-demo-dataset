Breathe
Dryden Goodwin
A multi-site public artwork by Dryden Goodwin
exploring air pollution and the power of activism,
Breathe features zoetropic drawings of Lewisham
based clean air campaigners and residents
'fighting for breath'
'. These include Rosamund
Adoo-Kissi-Debrah CBE, whose proposed 'Ella's Law'
bill would enshrine the right to clean air in UK law.
For Better Bankside's Clean Air Day, 15th June 2023,
this outdoor exhibition links with previous public
displays of the artwork across Lewisham, London
and the UK.
Taking over roadside buildings, bridges and
billboards, Breathe includes over 1,300 drawings,
and has appeared as individual and sequences
of posters, both still and animated, and large-scale
animated night projections. It has been viewed by
over 13 million people since its launch in May 2022.
Produced by art-science organisation Invisible Dust.
Originally commissioned by the
Albany for We Are Lewisham,
part of the Mayor of London's
Borough of Culture 2022.
